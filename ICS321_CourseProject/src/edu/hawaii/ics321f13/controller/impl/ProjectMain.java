         * FIXME Marks code which, in its current form, does not function as designed. This tag should be accompanied by a corresponding issue log in the Issue Tracker.
         * XXX This marks a workaround (a.k.a. hack) to get some section of code to work. This means that the solution is inefficient, inelegant, or otherwise needs revision. I totally understand
         * that you sometimes need to do this for whatever reason, just make sure you ALWAYS put this tag on the section of code (with a description) BEFORE you start hacking away.
